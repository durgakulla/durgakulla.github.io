Hi. I'm a second year medical student at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, based in New York City.
I became interested in research and education while attending Cornell University, and am committed to a path in medicine.
I've learned how to program from the internet, and I like to try and learn new things to expand my abilites.

### I want to create learning tools for those in the medical field and beyond.

If you want to help me with any of the projects I'm working on, feel free to reach out to me by [email](mailto:durga.kulla@gmail.com).
